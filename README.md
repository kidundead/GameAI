======

A Domino game with an Artificial Inteligence using Prolog and design using Java.

This is a project for my logic class at my University, it is for a group make a game using any language and made an 
AI using prolog. My group is me, Paiva: https://github.com/paivao and Meireles: https://github.com/LucasIME.
We decided to do a Domino Game with 3 AIs with diferent levels. We are using Netbeans for the project and jpl for the interface between Java and swi-prolog.


Thanks to https://code.google.com/p/game-engine-for-java/ for the class to rotate the domino's image.
